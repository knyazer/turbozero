# *turbozero* üèéÔ∏è üèéÔ∏è üèéÔ∏è üèéÔ∏è

üì£ If you're looking for the old PyTorch version of turbozero, it's been moved here: [turbozero_torch](https://github.com/lowrollr/turbozero_torch) üì£

#### *`turbozero`* is a vectorized implementation of [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/) written in JAX

It contains:
* Monte Carlo Tree Search with subtree persistence
* Batched Replay Memory
* A complete, customizable training/evaluation loop

#### *`turbozero`* is *_fast_* and *_parallelized_*:
 * every consequential part of the training loop is JIT-compiled
 * self-play and evaluation episodes are batched/vmapped with hardware-acceleration in mind

#### *`turbozero`* is *_extendable_*:
 * see an [idea on twitter](https://twitter.com/ptrschmdtnlsn/status/1748800529608888362) for a simple tweak to MCTS?
      * [implement it](https://github.com/lowrollr/turbozero/blob/main/core/evaluators/mcts/weighted_mcts.py) then [test it](https://github.com/lowrollr/turbozero/blob/main/notebooks/weighted_mcts.ipynb) by extending core components
  
#### *`turbozero`* is *_flexible_*:
 * easy to integrate with you custom JAX environment or neural network architecture.
 * Use the provided training and evaluation utilities, or pick and choose the components that you need.

To get started, check out the [Hello World Notebook](https://github.com/lowrollr/turbozero/blob/main/notebooks/hello_world.ipynb)

## Installation
`turbozero` uses `poetry` for dependency management, you can install it with:
```
pip install poetry
```
Then, to install dependencies:
```
poetry install
```
If you're using a GPU/TPU/etc., after running the previous command you'll need to install the device-specific version of JAX.

For a GPU w/ CUDA 12:
```
poetry source add jax https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
poetry add jax[cuda12_pip]==0.4.24
```
See https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html for other devices/cuda versions

I have had issues with this command when using poetry 1.8.1 -- but it works with 1.7.1.
I wish this could be done without extra commands but poetry does not support it :(

To launch an ipython kernel, run:
```
poetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name turbozero
```

## Future Work
While the current code is usable, I plan to continue to add features and documentation daily. I'll do a formal release or something when that slows down.
#### Priorities
* *speed improvements*: (there is plenty to be gained still)
* *new evaluation features*: mainly baselines and elo/tournament fun
* *documentation*: at the bare minimum trying for docstrings but having wiki pages again would also be nice

Once these short-term priorities are complete I'll be focusing on implementing other algorithms -- the long-term vision is to be the go-to source for anything in RL using a search tree. Not just MCTS. Not just two-player perfect information games. Also unit tests.

## Issues
If you use this project and encounter an issue, error, or undesired behavior, please submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/lowrollr/turbozero/issues) and I will do my best to resolve it as soon as I can. You may also contact me directly via `hello@jacob.land`.

## Contributing 
Contributions, improvements, and fixes are more than welcome! For now I don't have a formal process for this, other than creating a [Pull Request](https://github.com/lowrollr/turbozero/pulls). For large changes, consider creating an [Issue](https://github.com/lowrollr/turbozero/issues) beforehand.

If you are interested in contributing but don't know what to work on, please reach out. I have plenty of things you could do.
